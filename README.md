# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
This is the final project for SQL after learning the foundational knowledge of SQL for the past two weeks at Lighthouse Labs. The aim of this project is to download a provided messy real life data, understand the data, thoroughly clean the data (using SQL queries) for analytics. Next proceed to answer required questions related to the data and I will formulate a number of questions which I will also attempt to answer using the data.

Most importantly, the goal is to practice all I have learned from the bootcamp and also try myself to start thinking as a Data Scientist. By asking the right questions, observing patterns, trends through analytics and gaining insights from the data.

## Process
### Downloaded, read and tried to understand the data.
### Data cleaning and transformation were carried out.
### Answered required questions attached to the data.
### Created and answered questions that I'll like to find answers to from the data.
### Discussed and shared relevant insights discovered from the data.
### Documented the quality assurance process I carried out.

## Results
1. The largest revenue market was from the United States. The name of the city in the United States bringing in the highest revenue was missing from the raw data. Other high revenue generating cities in the United States are Sunnyvale, New York and Seattle. There is a huge potential for more financial returns if there is more focus on the United States. 

2. The product with the highest order is the Ballpoint pen or the Security camera after filtering some NULL values from the joins. 

3. The highest volume of sales was during the month of July (mid-summer). This is due to the fact that there everyone is mostly outdoors, compared to pre- or post- winter months.

4. Due to the Security cameras coming out on top for most of the query results from the data, there is probably an increase in break-ins in the United States during summer.

5. The 'Referral' channel had the highest number of orders across the globe having over 4 times the revenue generated through the 'Direct' channel (which had the second highest revenue). This means resources should be pumped into 'Referral' channels, so as to increase or maintain the current revenue.

## Challenges 
1. No background information on many aspects of the data set was provided and no explanation as to why some columns that are vital to financial analysis have so many NULL values (for example the revenue, productrevenue, productquantity, totaltransactionrevenue to mention a few).

2. Some of the columns were vague, for example the time column under the analytics table. Other examples are ecommerceaction_type and ecommerceaction_step under the all_sessions table.

3. The data was extremely messy, so much so that it took me a day to clean and transform the data alone.

## Future Goals
1. Establish a connection between the highest market revenue and what channel was used to bring their attention to visit the site.

2. Establish if there's a connection between the number of page visits and page views before the final decision to order is made.

3. Create another table that contains only the financial information from the analytics table. Create another table related to the number of page visits, page views and time on site. Doing this during the project, would mean I'll have to start all the calculations to answer the query questions from the beginning.

4. Try to establish the influence of sentimentscore with orders placed. Does this affect visitors decision to buy or decline?
